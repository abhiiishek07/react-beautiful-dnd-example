## What is React Beautiful DND ?
At its core, react-beautiful-dnd is a flexible and performant drag-and-drop library built specifically for React applications. It provides a set of components and utilities that make it easy to implement drag-and-drop interactions in your projects. The three main concepts to understand are:

1. Draggable: Represents an item that can be dragged by the user.
2. Droppable: Defines an area where draggable items can be dropped.
3. DragDropContext: Wraps the entire application and manages the drag-and-drop interactions.

## Installation and Setup:
Getting started with react-beautiful-dnd is straightforward. Begin by installing the library via npm or yarn.

```
npm install react-beautiful-dnd
```

Next, set up the DragDropContext to provide a context for drag-and-drop interactions within your application. This foundational step ensures that all draggable and droppable components can communicate with each other seamlessly.

## Creating Draggable Components:
With react-beautiful-dnd, transforming elements into draggable items is a breeze. Simply wrap your component with the Draggable component and specify a unique draggableId. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of draggable items using provided props like draggableId and index.

## Defining Droppable Areas:

Droppable components define areas where draggable items can be dropped. Simply wrap the desired elements with Droppable components to establish drop targets within your application. You can also nest Droppable components for more complex drag-and-drop layouts.

## Managing Drag-and-Drop State:

React-beautiful-dnd provides a set of callbacks to manage drag-and-drop state effectively. These callbacks, such as onDragStart, onDragUpdate, and onDragEnd, allow you to update application state dynamically in response to drag-and-drop interactions. This ensures smooth and responsive user experiences.
