## What is React Beautiful DND ?
React-beautiful-dnd is a flexible and performant drag-and-drop library for React applications. At its core are three key concepts: Draggable, Droppable, and DragDropContext. Draggable components represent items that users can drag, Droppable components define areas where these items can be dropped, and DragDropContext wraps the entire application to manage drag-and-drop interactions.
